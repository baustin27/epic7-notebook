# Progressive Web App (PWA) Features

Sleek Chat includes comprehensive PWA capabilities that provide a native app-like experience across all devices and platforms.

## Core PWA Features

### Offline Functionality

The app works seamlessly offline, allowing users to continue productive conversations without internet connectivity.

#### Offline Capabilities
- **View Conversations**: Access all previous conversations and messages
- **Compose Messages**: Write and queue messages for later sending
- **Navigate Interface**: Full navigation and UI interaction
- **Background Sync**: Automatic synchronization when connectivity returns

#### Data Persistence
- Conversations and messages are cached locally using IndexedDB
- Optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback
- Conflict resolution for concurrent offline edits
- Privacy-first approach with local-only sensitive data

### Installation Experience

Smart installation prompts appear for engaged users across all supported platforms.

#### Installation Triggers
- User engagement score (clicks, scrolls, interactions)
- Time-based delay to ensure meaningful engagement
- Platform-specific installation flows
- Dismissal tracking to avoid repeated prompts

#### Supported Platforms
- **Desktop**: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari
- **Mobile**: iOS Safari, Android Chrome
- **Tablets**: iPadOS, Android tablets

### App Shell Architecture

Instant loading experience with cached application shell and progressive content loading.

#### Performance Benefits
- **Instant Loading**: App shell loads in under 2 seconds
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Content loads as available
- **Background Updates**: Seamless service worker updates
- **Resource Caching**: Intelligent caching strategies

## Technical Implementation

### Service Worker

The service worker handles caching, background sync, and offline functionality.

```javascript
// Key features implemented:
- Network-first strategy for API calls
- Cache-first strategy for static assets
- Background sync for offline actions
- Push notification support
- Intelligent cache management
```

### Offline Storage

IndexedDB provides robust offline data storage with the following structure:

```javascript
// Database schema:
{
  conversations: {
    id: string,
    title: string,
    user_id: string,
    created_at: string,
    updated_at: string
  },
  messages: {
    id: string,
    conversation_id: string,
    content: string,
    role: 'user' | 'assistant',
    created_at: string,
    updated_at: string
  },
  offline_queue: {
    id: number,
    url: string,
    method: string,
    headers: object,
    body?: string,
    timestamp: number,
    retryCount: number
  }
}
```

### Background Sync

Automatic synchronization of offline actions when connectivity is restored.

#### Sync Process
1. Queue offline actions in IndexedDB
2. Monitor network status
3. Retry failed requests with exponential backoff
4. Resolve conflicts and update UI
5. Provide user feedback on sync status

## User Experience

### Offline Indicators

Clear visual indicators show connection status and sync progress.

#### Status Types
- **Online**: Green indicator with sync status
- **Offline**: Red indicator with offline messaging
- **Syncing**: Yellow indicator with progress feedback
- **Pending**: Orange indicator for queued actions

### Installation Flow

Seamless installation experience optimized for each platform.

#### Desktop Installation
1. Browser prompt appears for engaged users
2. One-click installation to desktop
3. App appears in start menu/applications
4. Automatic updates through service worker

#### Mobile Installation
1. Smart banner or install prompt
2. Add to home screen functionality
3. Native app icon and splash screen
4. Full-screen experience without browser UI

## Best Practices

### Performance Optimization

- **Lazy Loading**: Components load on demand
- **Code Splitting**: Bundle splitting for optimal loading
- **Image Optimization**: Responsive images with WebP support
- **Caching Strategies**: Intelligent cache management

### Privacy & Security

- **Local Data Only**: Sensitive data stays on device
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypted offline storage
- **Permission Management**: Granular permission requests
- **Data Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of old cached data

### Accessibility

- **Screen Reader Support**: Full ARIA implementation
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Complete keyboard accessibility
- **High Contrast**: Support for high contrast modes
- **Reduced Motion**: Respect user motion preferences

## Development & Testing

### Testing Offline Functionality

Comprehensive test suite covers offline scenarios:

```bash
# Run offline tests
npm run test:e2e -- --grep "offline"

# Test service worker
npm run test:unit -- --testPathPattern=service-worker

# Performance testing
npm run lighthouse -- --config lighthouserc.js
```

### Development Tools

- **Service Worker DevTools**: Chrome DevTools integration
- **Offline Mode**: Browser developer tools
- **Storage Inspector**: IndexedDB debugging
- **Network Throttling**: Simulate various connection speeds

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Service Worker Not Registering
```javascript
// Check service worker registration
navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(registrations => {
  console.log('Registered service workers:', registrations)
})
```

#### Offline Data Not Syncing
```javascript
// Manual sync trigger
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(registration => {
    registration.sync.register('sync-messages')
  })
}
```

#### Installation Not Working
```javascript
// Check installability criteria
window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', event => {
  console.log('Install prompt available')
  // Criteria met for installation
})
```
