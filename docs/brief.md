# Project Brief: Sleek Modern Chat Interface

## Executive Summary

This project aims to develop a sleek, modern, and lightweight chat interface inspired by Open WebUI and Claude's design, but with a minimalistic and faster feel. The application will be built using Next.js for the frontend framework, ensuring responsive design, dark/light mode toggle, and smooth animations. Key features include real-time messaging with streaming responses, message history management, model integration via OpenRouter, Supabase for data storage and authentication, and a clean UI built with Tailwind CSS. The solution addresses the need for a performant, extensible AI chat platform that prioritizes user experience and scalability.

## Problem Statement

Current AI chat interfaces, while functional, often suffer from bloated designs, slow performance, and limited extensibility. Users experience lag in real-time interactions, cumbersome UI for managing conversations, and challenges in integrating multiple AI models securely. Existing solutions like Open WebUI and Claude provide good foundations but lack the minimalistic approach and optimized performance needed for frequent, fast-paced AI interactions. This creates friction for developers and AI enthusiasts who require a streamlined, responsive tool that can handle real-time streaming, secure API management, and future model integrations without compromising on speed or usability.

## Proposed Solution

We will build a comprehensive chat interface application that combines the best aspects of existing designs with enhanced performance and extensibility. The core solution includes:

- A Next.js-based frontend with responsive design and smooth animations
- Real-time messaging with streaming response support
- Sidebar-based conversation management
- Multi-model integration starting with OpenRouter
- Supabase for secure data storage and authentication
- Tailwind CSS for clean, customizable styling
- Mobile-friendly and accessible design

The solution differentiates itself through its minimalistic approach, faster performance optimizations, and built-in extensibility for future AI model providers.
