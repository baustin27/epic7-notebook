# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Deliver a sleek, modern chat interface with minimalistic design and fast performance
- Enable real-time messaging with streaming responses and conversation management
- Integrate multiple AI models via OpenRouter with secure API key handling
- Provide responsive, accessible UI with dark/light mode and smooth animations
- Ensure scalable architecture using Next.js, Supabase, and extensible model providers
- Achieve <2s page load time and <200ms streaming latency

## Background Context

This PRD builds upon the project brief for a lightweight AI chat interface inspired by Open WebUI and Claude. The solution addresses the need for a performant, extensible platform that prioritizes user experience and developer productivity. By leveraging Next.js for frontend optimization, Supabase for secure data management, and OpenRouter for AI model access, the application will provide a streamlined alternative to existing chat interfaces that often suffer from bloated designs and performance issues.
