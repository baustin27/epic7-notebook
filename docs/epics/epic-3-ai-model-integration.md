# Epic 3: AI Model Integration - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal
Connect to OpenRouter API with model selection and streaming responses to enable AI-powered conversations, building upon the existing chat core functionality.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context
- **Current relevant functionality**: Next.js 14 project with Supabase integration, user authentication, basic UI layout, and complete chat messaging functionality
- **Technology stack**: Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth), pnpm workspace, Zustand state management
- **Integration points**: Existing message display components, conversation management system, Supabase database with conversations/messages tables

### Enhancement Details
- **What's being added/changed**: OpenRouter API integration for accessing multiple AI models with streaming responses, model selection interface, and AI message generation
- **How it integrates**: Leverages existing message system, adds AI provider service layer, extends current UI components with model selection dropdown
- **Success criteria**: Users can select AI models, send messages that generate streaming AI responses, and receive real-time AI replies within existing conversation structure

## Stories

1. **Story 3.1: OpenRouter API Integration** - Set up OpenRouter API client with authentication, error handling, and rate limiting
2. **Story 3.2: Model Selection Interface** - Create model dropdown in header with dynamic model loading and selection persistence
3. **Story 3.3: Streaming AI Responses** - Implement real-time AI response generation with typing indicators and smooth text streaming

## Compatibility Requirements

- ✅ Existing APIs remain unchanged (builds on current Supabase message structure)
- ✅ Database schema changes are backward compatible (extends existing messages table)
- ✅ UI changes follow existing patterns (uses established Tailwind/component structure)
- ✅ Performance impact is minimal (streaming responses enhance existing real-time capabilities)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: OpenRouter API failures or rate limiting affecting user experience
- **Mitigation**: Implement robust error handling, fallback mechanisms, and proper rate limiting with user feedback
- **Rollback Plan**: AI integration can be disabled via feature flag, falling back to manual message input only

## Definition of Done

- [x] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [x] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [x] Integration points working correctly
- [x] Documentation updated appropriately
- [x] No regression in existing features

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETED

**Epic 3 is already fully implemented in the codebase:**

### Story 3.1: OpenRouter API Integration ✅
- **Implemented in**: `src/lib/openrouter.ts`
- OpenRouter API client with authentication ✅
