# Epic 5: Advanced Features - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal
Implement advanced chat capabilities including file upload support, code syntax highlighting, chat export functionality, and prompt library to enhance user productivity and experience.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context
- **Current relevant functionality**: Complete AI chat interface with OpenRouter integration, message management, conversation handling, and streaming responses
- **Technology stack**: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth), OpenRouter API, Zustand state management
- **Integration points**: MessageBubble components, MessageInput component, conversation management system, existing file handling infrastructure

### Enhancement Details
- **What's being added/changed**: File upload capabilities for vision models, syntax highlighting for code responses, export functionality for conversations, and a prompt library for quick access to predefined prompts
- **How it integrates**: Extends existing message components with file handling, adds code rendering layers, creates export utilities, and integrates prompt management with conversation flow
- **Success criteria**: Users can upload images for vision models, view properly highlighted code, export conversations in multiple formats, and access/manage a library of useful prompts

## Stories

1. **Story 5.1: File Upload Support** - Add image upload functionality with preview, validation, and vision model integration
2. **Story 5.2: Code Syntax Highlighting** - Implement syntax highlighting for code blocks in AI responses with copy functionality
3. **Story 5.3: Chat Export Functionality** - Create export options for conversations in JSON, Markdown, and PDF formats
4. **Story 5.4: Prompt Library** - Build a prompt library system with categorization, search, and quick insertion capabilities

## Compatibility Requirements

- ✅ Existing APIs remain unchanged (builds on current message and conversation structure)
- ✅ Database schema changes are backward compatible (extends existing tables with optional fields)
- ✅ UI changes follow existing patterns (uses established Tailwind/component architecture)
- ✅ Performance impact is minimal (progressive enhancement approach)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: File upload security vulnerabilities and large file handling performance impact
- **Mitigation**: Implement strict file validation, size limits, and secure upload handling with virus scanning
- **Rollback Plan**: Advanced features can be disabled via feature flags, falling back to basic text-only chat functionality

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [ ] Integration points working correctly
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
- [ ] No regression in existing features
- [ ] Security review completed for file upload functionality
- [ ] Performance impact assessed and optimized

## Epic Dependencies

- **Depends on**: Epic 3 (AI Model Integration) - ✅ Completed
- **Blocks**: None (enhancement epic)

## Technical Notes

- File uploads require secure storage solution (Supabase Storage or similar)
- Code highlighting needs client-side syntax parser (Prism.js or highlight.js)
- Export functionality requires PDF generation library (jsPDF or similar)
- Prompt library needs efficient search and categorization system
- All features should be progressive enhancements that don't break existing functionality
