# Epic 11: Collaborative Intelligence

## Epic Goal
Transform the AI chat application into a collaborative platform enabling real-time team collaboration, shared AI workspaces, collective intelligence, and team-based AI assistance for enhanced productivity and knowledge sharing.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context
- **Current relevant functionality**: Enterprise-ready AI chat with user management, conversation analytics, admin controls, WebRTC infrastructure from Epic 10, and comprehensive security features
- **Technology stack**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase (with Realtime and RLS), OpenRouter API, WebRTC capabilities, admin dashboard, analytics system
- **Integration points**: User management system, conversation data structures, real-time capabilities, admin controls, analytics dashboard, security middleware

### Enhancement Details
- **What's being added/changed**: Real-time collaborative AI conversations, team workspaces with shared libraries, role-based collaboration controls, collaborative prompt development, team analytics and insights, integration with external team tools
- **How it integrates**: Leverages existing Supabase Realtime for collaboration, extends user management with team structures, enhances conversation system with collaborative features, builds on WebRTC infrastructure for peer-to-peer collaboration
- **Success criteria**: Teams can collaborate in real-time on AI conversations, shared workspaces enable knowledge sharing, collaborative features enhance team productivity, integration with team tools streamlines workflow

## Stories

1. **Story 11.1: Real-time Collaborative Conversations** - Implement live collaboration in AI conversations with simultaneous editing, cursors, and real-time updates
2. **Story 11.2: Team Workspaces & Organization** - Create team-based workspaces with shared conversation libraries, templates, and collaborative resources
3. **Story 11.3: Collaborative Prompt Development** - Build collaborative prompt library with version control, team sharing, and collective prompt improvement
4. **Story 11.4: Team Analytics & Intelligence** - Provide team-level analytics, collaboration insights, and collective AI usage patterns
5. **Story 11.5: Role-based Collaboration Controls** - Implement granular permissions, collaboration roles, and team governance features
6. **Story 11.6: External Platform Integration** - Connect with Slack, Teams, Discord, and other collaboration platforms for seamless workflow integration

## Compatibility Requirements

- ✅ Existing APIs remain unchanged (collaboration features are additive)
- ✅ Database schema changes are backward compatible (new collaborative tables and RLS policies)
- ✅ UI changes follow existing patterns (collaborative features integrated into current interface)
- ✅ Performance impact is minimal (real-time features optimized with selective updates)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: Real-time collaboration complexity could impact performance and conflict resolution in concurrent editing scenarios
- **Mitigation**: Implement operational transformation for conflict resolution, optimize real-time updates with selective broadcasting, comprehensive testing of collaborative scenarios, graceful degradation for connection issues
- **Rollback Plan**: Ability to disable collaborative features per workspace, fallback to individual conversation mode, traditional sharing mechanisms as backup

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Real-time collaboration working smoothly with conflict resolution
- [ ] Team workspaces providing effective knowledge organization and sharing
- [ ] Collaborative prompt development enhancing team AI capabilities
- [ ] Team analytics providing valuable insights into collaborative patterns
- [ ] Role-based controls ensuring appropriate access and permissions
- [ ] External platform integrations streamlining team workflows
- [ ] No regression in existing individual user functionality
- [ ] Performance maintained during collaborative sessions
- [ ] Security and privacy preserved in team contexts
- [ ] Comprehensive testing of collaborative scenarios and edge cases

## Epic Dependencies

- **Depends on**: Epic 7 (Enterprise Readiness) - ✅ Completed for user management, Epic 10 (Modern Web Platform) - ✅ Completed for WebRTC infrastructure
- **Blocks**: None (collaborative enhancement epic)

## Technical Notes

- Real-time collaboration requires operational transformation or CRDT implementation for conflict resolution
- Team workspaces need comprehensive RLS policies for secure multi-tenant collaboration
- Collaborative prompt development requires version control system with Git-like functionality
- Team analytics need aggregation queries optimized for large collaborative datasets
- Role-based controls require extension of existing auth system with fine-grained permissions
- External integrations need secure OAuth flows and webhook management
- WebRTC infrastructure from Epic 10 enables peer-to-peer collaborative features
- Performance optimization critical for real-time updates with multiple concurrent users

## Collaboration Architecture

- **Real-time Engine**: Supabase Realtime with optimized broadcasting and selective updates
- **Conflict Resolution**: Operational transformation for concurrent editing scenarios
- **Data Synchronization**: Event-driven updates with optimistic UI updates
- **Permission System**: Hierarchical role-based access with workspace-level controls
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive collaboration activity logging for governance
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports growing team sizes and concurrent collaboration

## Team Workspace Features

- **Shared Libraries**: Collaborative conversation and prompt libraries
- **Template System**: Team-specific conversation templates and workflows
- **Knowledge Base**: Searchable team knowledge repository
- **Onboarding**: Team member onboarding with guided setup
- **Governance**: Team policies and collaboration guidelines
- **Integration Hub**: Centralized external tool connections

## Security & Privacy Considerations

- **Data Isolation**: Complete team data separation with row-level security
- **Privacy Controls**: Granular privacy settings for shared content
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive collaboration activity tracking
- **Access Management**: Dynamic permission management with role inheritance
- **Compliance**: Team-level compliance features for enterprise requirements
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies for collaborative content

## External Integration Strategy
