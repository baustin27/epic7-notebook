# Epic 2: Chat Core Functionality - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal
Implement real-time messaging, message management, and conversation handling to enable core chat interactions, building upon the existing foundation infrastructure.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context
- **Current relevant functionality**: Next.js 14 project with Supabase integration, user authentication, basic UI layout, and environment configuration
- **Technology stack**: Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth), pnpm workspace
- **Integration points**: Supabase database with conversations/messages tables, authentication context, existing UI components

### Enhancement Details
- **What's being added/changed**: Core chat messaging functionality including message display, input/send capabilities, conversation management, and message editing/deletion
- **How it integrates**: Leverages existing Supabase schema and auth, extends current UI components, adds real-time subscriptions
- **Success criteria**: Users can send/receive messages, manage conversations, and interact with chat history in a responsive interface

## Stories

1. **Story 2.1: Message Display Enhancement** - Complete edit/delete functionality in MessageBubble component with proper interaction states
2. **Story 2.2: Message Input and Send** - Create message input field with send functionality, validation, and error handling  
3. **Story 2.3: Conversation Management** - Add conversation creation, renaming, deletion, and sidebar management

## Compatibility Requirements

- ✅ Existing APIs remain unchanged (Supabase schema already established)
- ✅ Database schema changes are backward compatible (using existing tables)
- ✅ UI changes follow existing patterns (extends current Tailwind/component structure)
- ✅ Performance impact is minimal (builds on existing real-time subscriptions)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: Message state management complexity with real-time updates
- **Mitigation**: Use established Supabase real-time subscriptions and React state patterns
- **Rollback Plan**: Database operations are non-destructive, UI components can be disabled via feature flags

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [ ] Integration points working correctly
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately  
- [ ] No regression in existing features

## Epic Dependencies

- **Depends on**: Epic 1 (Foundation & Core Infrastructure) - ✅ Completed
- **Blocks**: Epic 3 (AI Model Integration)

## Technical Notes

- Builds on existing MessageBubble and ChatArea components
- Uses established useMessages hook for real-time functionality
- Follows current Tailwind CSS design patterns
- Maintains compatibility with existing Supabase schema
