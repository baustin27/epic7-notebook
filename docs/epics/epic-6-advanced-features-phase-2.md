# Epic 6: Advanced Features - Phase 2

## Epic Goal
Complete the advanced feature set with code syntax highlighting, conversation export capabilities, prompt library, and advanced settings to provide a comprehensive AI chat experience.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context
- **Current relevant functionality**: Complete AI chat interface with file upload support (images), streaming responses, conversation management, and multi-model integration
- **Technology stack**: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage), OpenRouter API, React Context state management
- **Integration points**: MessageBubble components for code rendering, conversation data structures, existing settings system, file upload infrastructure

### Enhancement Details
- **What's being added/changed**: Syntax highlighting for code blocks, multi-format conversation export, comprehensive prompt library with categorization, and advanced model parameter controls
- **How it integrates**: Extends existing message rendering with syntax highlighting, adds export utilities to conversation management, creates prompt management system with database integration, enhances model selection with parameter controls
- **Success criteria**: Code blocks properly highlighted and copyable, conversations exportable in multiple formats, prompt library functional with search/categorization, advanced settings provide model parameter control

## Stories

1. **Story 6.1: Code Syntax Highlighting** - Implement comprehensive syntax highlighting with copy functionality using Prism.js or similar
2. **Story 6.2: Conversation Export System** - Create export capabilities for JSON, Markdown, and PDF formats with bulk export support
3. **Story 6.3: Prompt Library Management** - Build categorized prompt library with search, filtering, and quick insertion capabilities
4. **Story 6.4: Advanced Model Settings** - Implement model parameter controls (temperature, max tokens, system prompts) with user preferences

## Compatibility Requirements

- ✅ Existing APIs remain unchanged (builds on current conversation and message structures)
- ✅ Database schema changes are backward compatible (adds optional tables for prompts and preferences)
- ✅ UI changes follow existing patterns (extends current component architecture)
- ✅ Performance impact is minimal (client-side rendering for code, efficient export generation)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: Code highlighting performance impact on large code blocks and export generation memory usage
- **Mitigation**: Implement lazy loading for syntax highlighting, streaming for large exports, memory cleanup for PDF generation
- **Rollback Plan**: Feature flags for advanced features, ability to disable individual components, fallback to plain text rendering

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [ ] Code highlighting performance tested with large blocks
- [ ] Export functionality tested with large conversations
- [ ] Prompt library search and filtering performance validated
- [ ] No regression in existing features
- [ ] Advanced settings properly integrated with model selection

## Epic Dependencies

- **Depends on**: Epic 3 (AI Model Integration) - ✅ Completed, Epic 5 (Advanced Features Phase 1) - ✅ Partially Complete (File Upload Done)
- **Blocks**: Epic 7 (Enterprise Readiness)

## Technical Notes

- Syntax highlighting requires client-side code parsing library (Prism.js recommended)
- PDF export needs browser-compatible PDF generation (jsPDF or similar)
- Prompt library requires new Supabase table with proper RLS policies
- Advanced settings need OpenRouter API parameter support
- All features should be progressively enhanced for performance
- Code highlighting themes should match light/dark mode
