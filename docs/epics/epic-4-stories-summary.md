## Implementation Strategy

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)**
- **Story 4.5** (Performance) - Establish performance baseline and monitoring
- **Story 4.4** (Accessibility) - Begin WCAG implementation

### **Phase 2: Polish (Week 2-3)**
- **Story 4.3** (Animations) - Add visual polish and smooth interactions
- **Story 4.6** (UX Refinements) - Complete user experience details

### **Phase 3: Integration & Testing (Week 4)**
- Integration testing across all stories
- Performance validation with animations
- Accessibility testing with real users
- Cross-browser and device testing

## Success Metrics

### **Performance Targets**
- **Lighthouse Score:** >90 for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices
- **Bundle Size:** <500KB gzipped (20% reduction)
- **Core Web Vitals:** LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1

### **Accessibility Targets**
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:** 100%
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Complete coverage
- **Screen Reader Support:** Full compatibility (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)

### **User Experience Targets**
- **Error Recovery Rate:** >90%
- **Feature Discovery Rate:** >70% within first 3 interactions
- **Task Completion Rate:** >95%

## Risk Assessment

### **LOW RISK** ðŸŸ¢
- **Story 4.6** (UX Refinements) - Isolated improvements
- **Story 4.3** (Animations) - Progressive enhancement

### **MEDIUM RISK** ðŸŸ¡
- **Story 4.5** (Performance) - Potential impact on existing functionality
- **Story 4.4** (Accessibility) - Complex ARIA implementation

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- Comprehensive testing at each story completion
