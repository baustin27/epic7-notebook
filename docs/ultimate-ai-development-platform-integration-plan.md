Design an open-source collaborative project management platform inspired by Trello and Asana, but with an integrated infinite canvas feature for visual brainstorming and mapping (similar to Miro or Figma's canvas). Key requirements include:

- **Core Functionality**: Kanban-style boards with cards, lists, drag-and-drop task management, due dates, labels, attachments, and real-time collaboration via WebSockets or similar for multi-user editing.
- **Canvas Integration**: A flexible, zoomable canvas alongside boards for mind-mapping, flowcharts, sticky notes, and embedding tasks directly into visual elements. Allow seamless transitions between board and canvas views.
- **Collaboration Features**: User roles (admin, member, guest), comments, @mentions, activity feeds, notifications, and version history. Support integrations with GitHub, Slack, Google Workspace, and email.
- **Technical Stack**: Build with modern open-source tools—e.g., React/Next.js for frontend, Node.js/Express or Django for backend, PostgreSQL for database, Socket.io for real-time updates. Ensure responsive design for web and mobile.
- **Inspiration Sources**: Draw from open-source repos like WeKan (Trello clone), Taiga (project management), Plane.so (Asana alternative), and Excalidraw (canvas tool). Incorporate self-hosting options, API for extensions, and privacy-focused features like end-to-end encryption.
- **Enhancements**: Add AI-powered task suggestions, automated workflows, custom plugins, and analytics dashboards. Prioritize accessibility (WCAG compliance), scalability for teams of 1-1000+, and a clean, intuitive UI/UX.
