# Story 11.2: Team Workspaces & Organization

## User Story

As a team lead or organization member,
I want to create and manage team workspaces with shared conversation libraries, templates, and collaborative resources,
So that my team can organize their AI interactions effectively, share knowledge, and maintain consistent workflows across projects.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Current user management, conversation system, Sidebar.tsx navigation, authentication system
- Technology: Next.js 14, Supabase (PostgreSQL with RLS), user session management, existing conversation data structures
- Follows pattern: Existing sidebar organization patterns, conversation grouping, user permission models
- Touch points: User authentication, conversation persistence, navigation system, data organization patterns

**Current System Context:**
- **Relevant existing functionality**: Individual conversation management, user accounts, conversation history, sidebar navigation, admin user management system
- **Technology stack**: Supabase Auth with RLS, PostgreSQL database schema, conversation data structures, user session management
- **Integration points**: Sidebar component for workspace navigation, existing conversation CRUD operations, user management system, authentication middleware

## Technical Implementation Notes

**Database Schema Extensions:**
```sql
-- Team workspaces
CREATE TABLE workspaces (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name text NOT NULL,
    description text,
    avatar_url text,
    settings jsonb DEFAULT '{}',
    created_by uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Workspace memberships
CREATE TABLE workspace_members (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    workspace_id uuid REFERENCES workspaces(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    role text DEFAULT 'member', -- admin, moderator, member
    joined_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
    invited_by uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    status text DEFAULT 'active', -- active, pending, suspended
    permissions jsonb DEFAULT '{"can_invite": false, "can_manage_templates": false}'
);

-- Workspace invitations
CREATE TABLE workspace_invitations (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    workspace_id uuid REFERENCES workspaces(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    email text NOT NULL,
    invited_by uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    role text DEFAULT 'member',
    token text UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    expires_at timestamptz NOT NULL,
    accepted_at timestamptz,
    created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Workspace conversation templates
CREATE TABLE workspace_templates (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    workspace_id uuid REFERENCES workspaces(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    name text NOT NULL,
    description text,
    template_data jsonb NOT NULL,
    category text,
    created_by uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Extend conversations table for workspace context
ALTER TABLE conversations ADD COLUMN workspace_id uuid REFERENCES workspaces(id);
ALTER TABLE conversations ADD COLUMN is_shared boolean DEFAULT false;
ALTER TABLE conversations ADD COLUMN shared_at timestamptz;
```

**Component Architecture:**
- **WorkspaceSelector**: Dropdown/modal for workspace switching
- **WorkspaceSettings**: Admin panel for workspace management
- **MemberManagement**: User invitation and permission management
- **SharedLibrary**: Workspace conversation library browser

**RLS Policies:**
```sql
-- Workspace access control
CREATE POLICY workspace_access ON workspaces
    FOR ALL USING (
        id IN (
            SELECT workspace_id FROM workspace_members 
            WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND status = 'active'
        )
    );

-- Workspace member management
CREATE POLICY workspace_member_access ON workspace_members
    FOR ALL USING (
        workspace_id IN (
            SELECT workspace_id FROM workspace_members 
            WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND status = 'active'
        )
    );

-- Workspace conversations access
CREATE POLICY workspace_conversation_access ON conversations
    FOR ALL USING (
        workspace_id IS NULL OR 
        workspace_id IN (
            SELECT workspace_id FROM workspace_members 
            WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND status = 'active'
        )
    );
```
