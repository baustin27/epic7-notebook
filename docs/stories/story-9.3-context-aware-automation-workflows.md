# Story 9.3: Context-Aware Automation & Workflows - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **user of the AI chat application**,
I want **intelligent automation for repetitive tasks, smart conversation templates, and context-aware prompt suggestions**,
So that **I can streamline my workflows, save time on common interactions, and receive relevant automation options based on conversation context**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing conversation management, prompt library, message processing system
- Technology: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Supabase PostgreSQL, OpenRouter API, Zustand state management
- Follows pattern: Existing template and workflow patterns from onboarding and prompt suggestions
- Touch points: Conversation state, prompt selection UI, automation triggers in chat interface

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Automation workflows detect repetitive patterns in conversations and suggest templated responses or actions
2. Smart conversation templates allow users to create and apply reusable interaction sequences
3. Context-aware prompt suggestions appear based on current conversation topics and user history

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing conversation creation and management functionality continues to work unchanged
5. New automation features follow existing UI patterns for suggestion popups and template libraries
6. Integration with OpenRouter API maintains current behavior and adds workflow generation calls

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Automation detection and suggestions are covered by appropriate unit and integration tests
8. Workflow execution completes without interrupting user flow, with user confirmation for actions
9. No regression in existing prompt and conversation functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Enhance conversation hooks with pattern detection logic and template storage in Supabase, triggering suggestions via real-time analysis of message history
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Build on the existing prompt library and onboarding template patterns, extending Zustand stores for workflow state
- **Key Constraints:** Ensure automation suggestions respect user privacy by using only conversation data, implement opt-in for workflows, optimize detection to avoid false positives with configurable thresholds

## Definition of Done

- [x] Repetitive pattern detection and automation suggestions implemented
- [x] Smart template creation and application UI functional
- [x] Context-aware prompt suggestions integrated into chat interface
- [x] User confirmation flows for automated actions added
- [x] Integration with existing conversation system verified
- [x] Code follows existing TypeScript and component patterns
- [x] Tests pass including automation scenarios
- [x] OpenRouter API usage for workflow generation optimized

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Incorrect automation suggestions disrupting user workflows or generating unintended actions
- **Mitigation:** Require explicit user confirmation for all automated actions, use conservative pattern detection, and provide easy override options
- **Rollback:** Feature flag to disable automation features, reverting to manual prompt selection without changes to core chat

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing conversation APIs
- [ ] Database changes are additive only (new template tables)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing suggestion design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible with on-demand processing
