# Story 10.4: Real-time Collaboration Infrastructure - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a user of the AI chat application,
I want robust real-time communication infrastructure and peer-to-peer capabilities built into the platform,
So that the foundation is ready for future collaborative features like shared conversations and multi-user AI interactions.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Current Supabase Real-time subscriptions, existing WebSocket connections, user authentication system
- Technology: Next.js 14 with App Router, Supabase Real-time, existing TypeScript utilities and hooks
- Follows pattern: Existing real-time data flow with Supabase subscriptions and connection management
- Touch points: Real-time conversation updates, user session management, network connection handling

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **WebRTC Foundation**: Peer-to-peer connection establishment with secure signaling through existing Supabase infrastructure
2. **Real-time Presence System**: User online/offline status and activity indicators integrated with existing authentication
3. **Enhanced Connection Management**: Robust connection recovery and multi-tab synchronization building on current real-time subscriptions
4. **Collaboration-Ready Data Layer**: Infrastructure for shared state management and conflict resolution prepared for future features

**Integration Requirements:**

5. Existing Supabase Real-time subscriptions enhanced with WebRTC signaling without disrupting current functionality
6. Current user session management extended with presence and collaboration state tracking
7. Integration with existing connection management maintains current real-time message delivery patterns

**Quality Requirements:**

8. WebRTC implementation tested for peer-to-peer connection reliability across different network conditions
9. Presence system integrated with existing privacy settings and user preference management
10. Connection management maintains existing real-time performance with enhanced reliability features

## Technical Notes

**Integration Approach:**
- Layer WebRTC infrastructure over existing Supabase Real-time foundation
- Enhance current connection management with peer-to-peer capabilities
- Build collaboration-ready data structures extending existing conversation and message models

**Existing Pattern Reference:**
- Extend current real-time subscription patterns in `hooks/useRealtimeSubscription.ts`
- Build on existing connection management and error handling patterns
- Follow current user authentication and session management architecture

**Key Constraints:**
- WebRTC implementation must gracefully degrade when peer-to-peer connections fail
- Presence system must respect existing user privacy settings and preferences
- Infrastructure must be ready for collaboration without impacting current single-user performance

## WebRTC Infrastructure Implementation

**Signaling Architecture:**
```typescript
// WebRTC signaling through Supabase Real-time
interface CollaborationSignal {
  type: 'offer' | 'answer' | 'ice-candidate' | 'presence-update';
  from_user: string;
  to_user: string;
  data: RTCSessionDescription | RTCIceCandidate | PresenceData;
  conversation_id?: string;
}
```

**Peer Connection Management:**
- WebRTC peer connection lifecycle management
- ICE candidate collection and exchange through Supabase channels
- Connection state monitoring with automatic reconnection
- Fallback to server-mediated communication when P2P fails

**Security Integration:**
- Authentication-based signaling channel access
- Encrypted peer-to-peer data channels
- Integration with existing user permission and privacy systems

## Real-time Presence System

**Presence Data Structure:**
```typescript
interface UserPresence {
  user_id: string;
  status: 'online' | 'away' | 'offline';
  last_seen: timestamp;
  active_conversation?: string;
  collaboration_available: boolean;
  device_info: {
    type: 'desktop' | 'mobile' | 'tablet';
    browser: string;
  };
}
```

**Presence Management:**
- Real-time user status updates through existing Supabase channels
- Activity detection and automatic away/offline status management
- Multi-device presence aggregation and conflict resolution
- Integration with existing user privacy settings

**UI Integration Points:**
- User status indicators in existing conversation interfaces
- Activity awareness without disrupting current user experience
- Optional presence visibility controls following existing preference patterns

## Enhanced Connection Management

**Multi-tab Synchronization:**
- Shared connection state across browser tabs using BroadcastChannel API
- Efficient resource usage with single WebRTC connection per user pair
- Tab coordination for presence updates and connection management

**Connection Recovery:**
- Automatic WebRTC connection re-establishment on network changes
- Graceful fallback to Supabase Real-time when peer connections fail
- Connection quality monitoring with adaptive behavior

**Network Adaptation:**
- Network condition detection and connection optimization
- Adaptive streaming quality for future multimedia collaboration features
- Bandwidth-aware feature enablement and degradation

## Collaboration-Ready Data Layer

**Shared State Architecture:**
```typescript
interface CollaborationSession {
  session_id: string;
  conversation_id: string;
  participants: UserPresence[];
  shared_state: {
    cursor_positions?: Record<string, CursorPosition>;
    selection_ranges?: Record<string, SelectionRange>;
    typing_indicators?: Record<string, TypingIndicator>;
  };
  created_at: timestamp;
  updated_at: timestamp;
}
```

**Conflict Resolution Framework:**
- Operational transformation foundation for concurrent edits
- Vector clock implementation for distributed state synchronization
- Conflict detection and resolution strategies prepared for future features

**Data Synchronization:**
- Real-time state synchronization through WebRTC data channels
- Fallback synchronization through Supabase for reliability
- Efficient delta synchronization minimizing bandwidth usage

## Architecture Integration

**Infrastructure Layer:**
- WebRTC connection pool management with existing resource optimization patterns
- Enhanced Supabase Real-time channel management for signaling
- Collaboration state persistence with existing database patterns

**API Extensions:**
```typescript
// Enhanced hooks for collaboration infrastructure
interface CollaborationHooks {
  useWebRTCConnection: (targetUser: string) => WebRTCConnectionState;
  usePresenceStatus: (conversationId?: string) => PresenceState;
  useCollaborationSession: (sessionId: string) => CollaborationSessionState;
}
```

**Event System Integration:**
- Collaboration events integrated with existing event handling patterns
- Real-time event propagation through current subscription architecture
- Event persistence and replay for connection recovery scenarios
