# Story 5.2: Code Syntax Highlighting - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a user,
I want code blocks in AI responses to be syntax highlighted with copy functionality,
So that I can easily read, understand, and copy code snippets provided by the AI.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: MessageBubble component, AI response rendering, existing message display system
- Technology: React components, syntax highlighting library (Prism.js/highlight.js), Tailwind CSS
- Follows pattern: Existing message content rendering patterns in MessageBubble
- Touch points: Message content parsing, code block detection, theme integration

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Automatic detection and highlighting of code blocks in AI responses (```language format)
2. Support for common programming languages (JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, SQL, etc.)
3. Copy-to-clipboard button for each code block with success feedback
4. Line numbers displayed for longer code blocks (>5 lines)
5. Theme-aware syntax highlighting that adapts to dark/light mode

**Integration Requirements:**
6. Existing message display continues to work unchanged for non-code content
7. New syntax highlighting follows existing Tailwind styling patterns
8. Integration with current theme system maintains consistent appearance
9. Code highlighting performance doesn't impact message rendering speed

**Quality Requirements:**
10. Syntax highlighting component is covered by appropriate tests
11. Performance optimized for large code blocks and multiple code snippets
12. Accessibility support for screen readers and keyboard navigation
13. Copy functionality works reliably across different browsers

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Extend MessageBubble component with code detection and highlighting capabilities
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow message content rendering patterns and theme integration used in current components
- **Key Constraints**: Must maintain fast rendering performance, support multiple languages efficiently

## Definition of Done

- [x] Code block detection and highlighting implemented
- [x] Copy-to-clipboard functionality working
- [x] Line numbers added for longer code blocks
- [x] Theme integration completed
- [x] Multi-language syntax support verified
- [x] Existing message rendering regression tested
- [x] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [x] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [x] Performance benchmarks meet requirements

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk**: Large code blocks causing performance issues, syntax highlighting breaking message layout
- **Mitigation**: Lazy loading for large code blocks, fallback to plain text if highlighting fails
- **Rollback**: Can fall back to plain code blocks without syntax highlighting

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [x] No breaking changes to existing message display APIs
- [x] Message layout remains responsive with code blocks
- [x] Theme switching works correctly with highlighted code
- [x] Performance impact on message rendering is minimal
