# Story 7.4: Multi-tenant Architecture - Enterprise Enhancement

## User Story

As an **enterprise platform administrator**,
I want **complete multi-tenant architecture with organization support, proper data isolation, role-based access control, and billing integration foundations**,
So that **multiple organizations can use the platform independently with guaranteed data separation, organizational management, and scalable billing capabilities**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Existing Supabase database schema, authentication system, RLS policies, user management
- Technology: Supabase PostgreSQL with RLS, Next.js 14, TypeScript, existing authentication patterns
- Follows pattern: Current RLS implementation, authentication middleware, database access patterns
- Touch points: All database tables, authentication flows, API endpoints, data access layers

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Organization Management System**: Complete organization creation, management, and user assignment with hierarchical role structures
2. **Data Isolation Implementation**: Comprehensive tenant data separation using Row Level Security (RLS) with complete isolation guarantees
3. **Role-Based Access Control**: Sophisticated permission system with organization-level and system-level roles and permissions
4. **Billing Integration Foundations**: Organization-based usage tracking, subscription management preparation, and billing API integration readiness

**Integration Requirements:**

5. Existing single-tenant functionality continues to work unchanged with automatic organization assignment
6. Current RLS policies are enhanced to support multi-tenant data isolation
7. Authentication system seamlessly extends to support organization context and role management

**Quality Requirements:**

8. Complete data isolation verified through comprehensive testing with zero cross-tenant data leakage
9. Multi-tenant performance impact minimized with optimized queries and proper indexing
10. Organization switching and role management provide smooth user experience
11. Billing preparation supports scalable usage tracking without performance degradation

## Technical Notes

**Integration Approach:**
- Extend existing database schema with organization tables and tenant-aware modifications
- Enhance current RLS policies to support organization-based data isolation
- Implement organization context in authentication middleware and API layers
- Create billing foundation with usage tracking and subscription management preparation

**Database Schema Changes:**
- Add `organizations` table with comprehensive org management features
- Create `organization_members` table with role-based membership
- Modify existing tables to include `organization_id` for tenant isolation
- Implement comprehensive RLS policies for complete data separation

**Key Constraints:**
- Absolute data isolation between organizations must be maintained
- Single-tenant users must be seamlessly migrated to default organization
- Performance impact must be minimal with proper query optimization
- Billing tracking must be accurate and tamper-resistant

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Organization management system allows complete org lifecycle management
- [ ] Data isolation implemented with comprehensive RLS policies and verified through testing
- [ ] Role-based access control provides sophisticated permission management
- [ ] Billing integration foundations support usage tracking and subscription management
- [ ] Existing single-tenant functionality seamlessly migrated to multi-tenant architecture
- [ ] Multi-tenant performance impact measured and optimized
- [ ] Complete data isolation verified through penetration testing
- [ ] Organization switching provides smooth user experience
- [ ] Billing usage tracking accurate and performant
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested and verified unchanged

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Primary Risk:** Data isolation failure could lead to cross-tenant data exposure and serious security breaches

**Mitigation:** 
- Comprehensive RLS policy implementation with multiple layers of protection
- Extensive testing including penetration testing for data isolation verification
- Database-level constraints and triggers for additional data protection
- Monitoring and alerting for any cross-tenant data access attempts

**Rollback:** 
- Feature flags allow reverting to single-tenant mode
- Organization assignments can be removed to restore single-tenant functionality
- RLS policies can be reverted to original single-tenant versions

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [x] Existing functionality preserved through automatic organization assignment
- [x] Database changes maintain backward compatibility
- [x] API endpoints extended but existing behavior maintained
- [x] Performance impact minimized through optimization
