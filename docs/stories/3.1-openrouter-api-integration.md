# Story 3.1: OpenRouter API Integration - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a developer,
I want to integrate the OpenRouter API with secure authentication and error handling,
So that the application can access multiple AI models reliably and securely.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Next.js API routes and existing message handling system
- Technology: Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript, Supabase
- Follows pattern: Existing API route patterns in `/api` directory
- Touch points: Message creation flow, environment configuration, error handling system

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. OpenRouter API client configured with proper authentication using API keys
2. Error handling implemented for API failures, rate limits, and network issues
3. Rate limiting implemented to respect OpenRouter API quotas
4. Secure API key storage and management through environment variables

**Integration Requirements:**
5. Existing message handling continues to work unchanged
6. New API client follows existing Next.js API route pattern
7. Integration with current error handling system maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**
8. API client is covered by appropriate unit tests
9. Documentation is updated with API integration details
10. No regression in existing message functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Create OpenRouter service layer that integrates with existing API routes
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow `/api` route patterns and error handling used in current Supabase integration
- **Key Constraints**: Must maintain security best practices for API key handling, respect rate limits

## Definition of Done

- [ ] OpenRouter API client implemented with authentication
- [ ] Error handling covers all failure scenarios
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented and tested
- [ ] API key security verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated with integration details

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk**: API key exposure or rate limit exceeded
- **Mitigation**: Secure environment variable handling, proper rate limiting implementation
- **Rollback**: API integration can be disabled, falling back to existing message system

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Environment configuration follows existing patterns
- [ ] UI remains unchanged during this story
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible
