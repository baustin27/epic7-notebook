## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Story 1.2 (Supabase Integration)** completed successfully:
- Supabase client configured and working
- Authentication system fully functional
- Environment variables properly set
- Connection testing implemented
- Database types defined (but need to be updated with actual schema)

### Data Models
Based on PRD requirements and current implementation:
- **Users**: id, email, full_name, avatar_url, api_keys, created_at, updated_at
- **Conversations**: id, title, user_id, model, is_active, created_at, updated_at
- **Messages**: id, conversation_id, role, content, metadata, created_at, updated_at
- **User Settings**: id, user_id, theme, default_model, preferences, created_at, updated_at

[Source: docs/prd.md#requirements, current database types]

### Supabase Configuration
- Project URL and keys already configured
- Real-time enabled in client setup
- Authentication working properly
- Need to create tables via SQL Editor or migrations

[Source: apps/web/.env.local, apps/web/src/lib/supabase.ts]

### Security Requirements
- RLS must be enabled on all tables
- Users can only access their own data
- API keys must be encrypted in database
- Secure access patterns for real-time subscriptions

[Source: docs/architecture.md#security-performance]

### Real-time Requirements
- Live message updates within conversations
- Real-time conversation list updates
- Typing indicators (future enhancement)
- Connection status monitoring

[Source: docs/prd.md#functional-requirements FR1, FR2]

### File Locations
- Database schema: Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
- Updated types: `apps/web/src/types/database.ts`
- Real-time hooks: `apps/web/src/hooks/useRealtime.ts`
- Database utilities: `apps/web/src/lib/database.ts`

[Source: docs/architecture.md#unified-project-structure]

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for database operations
- Integration tests for real-time functionality
- Performance tests for query optimization
- Security tests for RLS policies

[Source: docs/architecture.md#testing-strategy]

## Testing
- Database connection and basic operations
- RLS policy enforcement
