# Story 3.3: Streaming AI Responses - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a user,
I want to see AI responses stream in real-time with typing indicators,
So that I can follow the AI's response generation and get immediate feedback.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: MessageBubble component, real-time messaging system, conversation flow
- Technology: React components, Server-Sent Events, Supabase real-time subscriptions
- Follows pattern: Existing message display and real-time update patterns
- Touch points: Message display, message creation flow, real-time subscription system

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. AI messages stream in real-time character by character from OpenRouter API
2. Typing indicator displays while AI is generating response
3. Smooth text animation during streaming with proper word wrapping
4. Error handling for stream interruptions with graceful fallback
5. Message completion detection and proper finalization

**Integration Requirements:**
6. Existing message display continues to work unchanged for user messages
7. New streaming follows existing MessageBubble component patterns
8. Integration with real-time subscription system maintains current behavior

**Quality Requirements:**
9. Streaming functionality is covered by appropriate tests
10. Performance optimized for long responses and multiple concurrent streams
11. No regression in existing messaging functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Extend MessageBubble component to support streaming, integrate with OpenRouter API streaming endpoint
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow message rendering patterns and real-time update handling used in current chat system
- **Key Constraints**: Must maintain smooth performance, handle network interruptions gracefully

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Streaming AI responses implemented with real-time display
- [ ] Typing indicator added during generation
- [ ] Stream interruption handling implemented
- [ ] Message completion detection working
- [ ] Performance optimized for long responses
- [ ] Existing messaging functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Smooth user experience verified

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk**: Streaming performance issues or connection failures
- **Mitigation**: Stream buffering, connection retry logic, fallback to complete response
- **Rollback**: Can fall back to complete response delivery instead of streaming

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing message APIs
- [ ] Message display performance maintained
- [ ] Existing real-time functionality preserved
- [ ] Network failure handling improved
