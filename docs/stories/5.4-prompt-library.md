# Story 5.4: Prompt Library - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a user,
I want access to a library of predefined prompts with categorization and search capabilities,
So that I can quickly start conversations with well-crafted prompts and improve my AI interactions.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: MessageInput component, conversation creation flow, existing UI layout system
- Technology: React components, search functionality, prompt data management, Zustand state or local storage
- Follows pattern: Existing modal and dropdown patterns, message input integration
- Touch points: Message input area, prompt data storage, conversation initialization

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Prompt library button/icon added near MessageInput with accessible modal interface
2. Categorized prompt collections (Writing, Coding, Analysis, Creative, Business, etc.)
3. Search functionality to filter prompts by keyword, category, or content
4. Quick insert capability that populates MessageInput with selected prompt
5. Custom prompt creation and editing with user-defined categories

**Integration Requirements:**
6. Existing message input workflow continues to work unchanged
7. New prompt library follows existing modal and interaction patterns
8. Integration with current message input system maintains all existing functionality
9. Prompt data storage works with existing user data management

**Quality Requirements:**
10. Prompt library component is covered by appropriate unit tests
11. Search performance optimized for large prompt collections
12. User interface responsive and accessible with keyboard navigation
13. Prompt insertion works smoothly without disrupting user flow

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Create prompt library modal system that integrates with MessageInput component
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow existing modal patterns and input handling used throughout the application
- **Key Constraints**: Must not interfere with existing message flow, maintain good UX for prompt discovery

## Definition of Done

- [x] Prompt library modal interface implemented
- [x] Categorization system for prompts working
- [x] Search and filter functionality implemented
- [x] Quick insert capability integrated with MessageInput
- [x] Custom prompt creation and editing functionality
- [x] Default prompt collection seeded
- [x] Existing message input functionality regression tested
- [x] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [x] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [x] Accessibility requirements met

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk**: Prompt library modal interfering with existing UI, performance issues with large prompt collections
- **Mitigation**: Modal z-index management, virtualized lists for large collections, lazy loading
- **Rollback**: Prompt library can be disabled, falling back to manual prompt entry

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [x] No breaking changes to existing message input APIs
- [x] Modal system doesn't conflict with existing modals
- [x] Prompt insertion preserves all MessageInput functionality
- [x] User data storage follows existing privacy patterns
