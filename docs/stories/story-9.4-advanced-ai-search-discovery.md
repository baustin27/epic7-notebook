# Story 9.4: Advanced AI Search & Discovery - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **user of the AI chat application**,
I want **semantic search across conversations, intelligent conversation categorization, and AI-powered content discovery**,
So that **I can quickly locate relevant past interactions, organize content by themes, and discover related insights without manual sifting**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing conversation search functionality, database querying, analytics system
- Technology: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Supabase PostgreSQL with vector support, OpenRouter API, Zustand state management
- Follows pattern: Existing search and filtering patterns in conversation list and analytics dashboard
- Touch points: Conversation listing UI, search input, database queries for messages

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Semantic search uses AI embeddings to find conversations based on meaning, not just keywords
2. Intelligent categorization automatically tags and groups conversations by topics and types
3. AI-powered discovery suggests related conversations and content based on current search or context

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing basic search and conversation listing functionality continues to work unchanged
5. New advanced search features follow existing UI patterns for results display and filters
6. Integration with Supabase maintains current behavior and adds vector search capabilities

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Search accuracy and categorization are covered by appropriate unit and integration tests
8. Search results load with minimal latency (<1s for typical queries) using indexed embeddings
9. No regression in existing search and conversation management functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extend Supabase with vector extensions for embeddings, add AI endpoint to generate and store embeddings for conversations, integrate into search hooks with fallback to keyword search
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow the existing conversation filtering and analytics query patterns, leveraging Supabase realtime for updated search results
- **Key Constraints:** Ensure embedding generation is batched and background-processed to avoid real-time overhead, respect data privacy in search indexing, support hybrid search (semantic + keyword) for robustness

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Semantic search implementation with embedding storage and querying
- [ ] Automatic categorization and tagging of conversations
- [ ] AI discovery suggestions integrated into search results
- [ ] Hybrid search fallback for non-semantic queries
- [ ] Integration with existing search UI verified
- [ ] Code follows existing TypeScript and query patterns
- [ ] Tests pass including search accuracy scenarios
- [ ] Supabase schema updated additively with vector support

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Inaccurate semantic search results leading to poor user experience or privacy concerns from embeddings
- **Mitigation:** Use configurable similarity thresholds, allow user feedback to refine models, ensure embeddings are anonymized and opt-in
- **Rollback:** Feature flag to disable advanced search, reverting to keyword-only search without database changes

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing search APIs
- [ ] Database changes are additive only (vector columns and indexes)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing results display patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible with indexed vector search
