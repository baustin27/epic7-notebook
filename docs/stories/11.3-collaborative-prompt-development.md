# Story 11.3: Collaborative Prompt Development

## User Story

As a team member working with AI prompts,
I want to collaboratively create, edit, and improve prompts with my team using version control, shared libraries, and collective feedback,
So that we can build better AI interactions through team knowledge, maintain prompt quality, and standardize effective patterns across our organization.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Current PromptLibrary.tsx, PromptService, custom prompts system, workspace context from Story 11.2
- Technology: Next.js 14, Supabase database for prompt storage, existing prompt categorization system, user authentication
- Follows pattern: Existing prompt creation/editing workflows, database CRUD patterns, user-scoped data access
- Touch points: Prompt library component, conversation creation flow, workspace member permissions, template systems

**Current System Context:**
- **Relevant existing functionality**: Individual prompt library with custom prompts, prompt categories, search functionality, prompt creation/editing interface
- **Technology stack**: PromptService for database operations, custom prompts storage in Supabase, React components for prompt management
- **Integration points**: PromptLibrary component, conversation initialization, workspace template system, user permission model
- **Existing patterns**: CRUD operations for prompts, categorization and search, user-owned prompt libraries
