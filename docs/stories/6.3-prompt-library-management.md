# Story 6.3: Prompt Library Management - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a user,
I want to save, organize, and quickly reuse prompts in a categorized library,
So that I can efficiently access my most useful prompts and improve my workflow without retyping common requests.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Message input system, user settings, database infrastructure
- Technology: React components, Supabase database with new prompts table, search functionality
- Follows pattern: Existing modal patterns, data management similar to conversations
- Touch points: MessageInput component, settings system, database layer

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Add prompt library button/icon to message input area
2. Create prompt library modal with categorized view (General, Coding, Writing, Analysis, Custom)
3. Search and filter prompts by name, category, or content
4. Save current input as new prompt with name and category
5. Quick-insert prompts into message input with single click
6. Edit and delete existing prompts
7. Pre-populate with common useful prompts as defaults

**Integration Requirements:**
8. Existing message input functionality continues to work unchanged
9. New prompt library follows existing modal and interaction patterns
10. Integration with user settings for personal prompt management
11. Database schema extends existing structure with backward compatibility

**Quality Requirements:**
12. Prompt search is fast and responsive
13. Library loads efficiently even with many saved prompts  
14. Prompts are properly scoped to individual users
15. Error handling for database operations with user-friendly messages

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Add prompts table to Supabase with proper RLS policies, extend MessageInput with prompt selection
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow existing modal patterns used in settings and export functionality
- **Key Constraints**: Must maintain user privacy, efficient search with many prompts, proper data validation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Prompts database table created with proper schema and RLS policies
- [ ] Prompt library button added to message input area
- [ ] Categorized prompt library modal implemented
- [ ] Search and filter functionality working
- [ ] Save new prompt functionality working
- [ ] Quick-insert prompts into input working
- [ ] Edit and delete existing prompts working
- [ ] Default prompts populated for new users
- [ ] Existing message input functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Prompt management works across browser sessions

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk**: Database schema changes, search performance with large prompt libraries
- **Mitigation**: Backward compatible schema additions, indexed search fields, pagination for large libraries
- **Rollback**: Prompt library can be disabled, message input remains fully functional

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing message input APIs
- [ ] Database changes are additive only (new prompts table)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal with efficient queries
