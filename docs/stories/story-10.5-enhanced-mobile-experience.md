## Technical Notes

**Integration Approach:**
- Layer touch gesture recognition over existing event handling system
- Enhance current responsive components with mobile-specific interaction patterns
- Integrate device APIs with existing file handling and input management systems

**Existing Pattern Reference:**
- Build on current responsive design patterns in Tailwind configuration and component system
- Extend existing file upload functionality with camera and device integration
- Follow current accessibility patterns with mobile-specific enhancements

**Key Constraints:**
- Touch gestures must not interfere with existing accessibility features (screen readers, voice control)
- Mobile optimizations must maintain feature parity with desktop experience
- Device integration must handle permission denials gracefully with existing functionality

## Advanced Touch Gesture Implementation

**Gesture Recognition System:**
```typescript
interface TouchGestureConfig {
  swipeThreshold: number;
  longPressDelay: number;
  pinchSensitivity: number;
  hapticFeedback: boolean;
}

interface GestureHandlers {
  onSwipeLeft?: (element: HTMLElement) => void;
  onSwipeRight?: (element: HTMLElement) => void;
  onLongPress?: (element: HTMLElement, position: TouchPosition) => void;
  onPinchZoom?: (scale: number, element: HTMLElement) => void;
  onPullRefresh?: () => void;
}
```

**Message Interaction Gestures:**
- Swipe left on messages to reveal delete/share/copy actions
- Long press for context menu with message options
- Pinch-to-zoom for code blocks and images
- Pull-to-refresh for conversation list and message history

**Conversation Management Gestures:**
- Swipe-to-delete conversations with undo functionality
- Long press conversations for bulk selection mode
- Pull-to-refresh conversation list with loading indicators

## Mobile-Optimized UI Patterns

**Bottom Sheet Modal System:**
```typescript
interface BottomSheetProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  snapPoints?: ('25%' | '50%' | '75%' | '100%')[];
  backdrop?: boolean;
  dragHandle?: boolean;
}
```

**Mobile Navigation Enhancement:**
- Bottom tab navigation for primary actions
- Floating action button for new conversation creation
- Slide-out drawer for settings and secondary navigation
- Contextual action sheets for conversation options

**Touch-Friendly Interface Elements:**
- Minimum 44px touch targets following accessibility guidelines
- Thumb-zone optimization for single-handed usage
- Enhanced visual feedback for touch interactions
- Mobile-optimized form controls and inputs

## Device Integration Features

**Camera Integration:**
```typescript
interface CameraCapture {
  mode: 'photo' | 'document' | 'whiteboard';
  quality: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  facing: 'user' | 'environment';
}
```

**Enhanced File Upload:**
- Direct camera capture for image uploads
- Document scanning mode for text recognition
- Multiple image selection with preview
- Camera permission handling with graceful fallbacks

**Voice Input Integration:**
- Speech-to-text for message composition
- Voice recording for audio messages (future preparation)
- Microphone permission management with clear user communication
- Network-aware voice processing with offline fallback

**Haptic Feedback System:**
```typescript
interface HapticPatterns {
  light: () => void;           // Success confirmations
  medium: () => void;          // Warning notifications  
  heavy: () => void;           // Error alerts
  selection: () => void;       // Item selection
  impact: () => void;          // Button presses
}
```

## Mobile Performance Optimization

**Rendering Performance:**
- Virtual scrolling for long conversation histories
- Optimized touch event handling with passive listeners
- GPU-accelerated animations for smooth 60 FPS performance
- Memory-efficient image loading with progressive enhancement

**Bundle Optimization:**
```typescript
// Mobile-specific code splitting
const MobileGestures = lazy(() => import('./mobile/MobileGestures'));
const CameraCapture = lazy(() => import('./mobile/CameraCapture'));
const VoiceInput = lazy(() => import('./mobile/VoiceInput'));
```

**Battery Optimization:**
- Efficient background processing with minimal CPU usage
- Adaptive refresh rates based on user activity
- Network request optimization for cellular connections
- Background sync throttling to preserve battery life

## Architecture Integration

**Mobile-First Component Architecture:**
```typescript
// Enhanced responsive hooks
interface MobileHooks {
  useTouchGestures: (config: TouchGestureConfig) => GestureHandlers;
  useDeviceCapabilities: () => DeviceCapabilities;
  useBottomSheet: (props: BottomSheetProps) => BottomSheetState;
  useHapticFeedback: () => HapticPatterns;
}
```

**Responsive Design Enhancement:**
- Mobile-first CSS with progressive enhancement for desktop
- Container queries for component-level responsiveness
- Mobile-specific component variants with consistent API
- Touch-optimized spacing and sizing using CSS custom properties

**Device API Abstraction:**
```typescript
interface DeviceAPI {
  camera: CameraAPI;
  microphone: MicrophoneAPI;
  haptics: HapticAPI;
  orientation: OrientationAPI;
}
```
