# Story 3: Implement Model Filtering and Search System

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user selecting models,  
**I want** standardized search, sorting, and filtering capabilities across all providers in the ModelSelector,  
**so that** I can quickly find and choose the right model from large lists (e.g., OpenRouter's extensive catalog), improving usability and efficiency.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ModelSelector includes a search input that filters models by name, ID, description, or provider across all loaded models.
2. Sorting options: Dropdown for sorting by name, provider, pricing (low to high), context length.
3. Filtering: Checkboxes or toggles for providers, pricing tiers (free/paid), capabilities (e.g., vision, function calling).
4. Filters and search apply in real-time, updating the dropdown list dynamically.
5. Pagination for results if more than 50 models, with "Show more" button.
6. Playwright e2e test: Search for a specific model (e.g., "gpt-4"), verify it appears first, apply filter by provider, confirm results.
7. Performance: Filtering/search completes in under 200ms for 100+ models.
8. Accessibility: Keyboard navigation and ARIA labels for filters/search.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Add pagination logic if model count exceeds threshold
- [ ] Write Playwright test for search, filter, and sort interactions
  - [ ] Test end-to-end from selector open to model selection
