# Story 4: Add Rate Limiting and Cost Protection for LLM Features

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** system administrator and developer,  
**I want** rate limiting and cost protection mechanisms for LLM features like writing assistant and auto-complete,  
**so that** credit overconsumption is prevented, especially during development where free models are enforced, ensuring sustainable usage.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Backend middleware or API routes implement rate limiting (e.g., 10 requests/min per user for non-free features).
2. Cost tracking: Log API costs and total credits used, with alerts at 80% threshold.
3. Development environment enforcement: Force free OpenRouter models for features like writing assistant; block paid models.
4. User notifications: Frontend alerts when approaching limits or when free-only mode is active.
5. Configurable limits via admin settings (e.g., requests per hour, daily credit cap).
6. Integration test for rate limiting (simulate multiple requests, verify 429 response after limit).
7. Playwright e2e test: Attempt multiple requests in writing assistant, verify blocking after limit and free model usage.
8. Audit logs for limit breaches and cost events.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement rate limiting middleware using e.g., express-rate-limit or Next.js built-in
  - [x] Apply to /api/chat and related LLM endpoints
  - [x] Configure per-user and global limits
- [x] Add cost tracking in provider clients (e.g., calculate based on pricing metadata)
- [x] Enforce free models in dev: Check process.env.NODE_ENV and restrict to free models
- [x] Frontend notifications for limits and free-only mode
- [x] Create admin config for limits (integrate with model management page)
- [x] Write integration tests for rate limiting and cost calculation
- [x] Write Playwright test for feature blocking and notifications

## Dev Notes
Relevant Source Tree:
- middleware.ts: Add rate limiting logic
- lib/providers/: Enhance with cost estimation methods
- components/settings/: Add config UI for limits

Testing Standards:
- Test file location: apps/web/__tests__/api/rate-limit.test.ts and apps/web/tests/e2e/writing-assistant-limit.spec.ts
- Test standards: Unit for backend, e2e for frontend interactions
- Testing frameworks: Jest for backend, Playwright with MCP server for frontend
- Specific requirements: Test after backend changes, simulate API responses for costs
