# Story 11.1: Real-time Collaborative Conversations

## User Story

As a team member working on complex AI conversations,
I want to collaborate in real-time with my teammates on AI chats with live cursors, simultaneous editing, and instant updates,
So that we can leverage collective intelligence, share context seamlessly, and build better AI interactions together.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Current conversation system, MessageInput.tsx, MessageBubble.tsx, ChatArea.tsx
- Technology: Next.js 14, Supabase Realtime, PostgreSQL with RLS, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Follows pattern: Existing real-time patterns from Supabase Realtime subscriptions
- Touch points: Conversation state management, user authentication, message persistence, real-time subscriptions

**Current System Context:**
- **Relevant existing functionality**: Individual AI conversations with message persistence, user authentication, real-time message updates, conversation management in Sidebar.tsx
- **Technology stack**: Next.js 14, Supabase (Realtime + RLS), TypeScript, React Context/Zustand state management
- **Integration points**: MessageInput component for input handling, conversation data structures, user management system, Supabase Realtime infrastructure
- **Existing patterns**: Real-time message updates via Supabase subscriptions, conversation threading, user session management

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Real-time Collaboration Engine**
   - Multiple users can join the same conversation simultaneously
   - Live cursors show where other users are typing in the MessageInput
   - Real-time presence indicators show who is currently active in the conversation
   - Typing indicators display when collaborators are composing messages

2. **Collaborative Message Composition**
   - Multiple users can edit the same message input simultaneously
   - Operational transformation prevents conflicts during concurrent editing
   - Real-time synchronization of text changes with sub-second latency
   - Draft messages are shared and synchronized across all collaborators

3. **Conflict Resolution System**
   - Concurrent edits are merged using operational transformation algorithms
   - User intentions are preserved when resolving conflicts
   - Graceful handling of network disconnections and reconnections
   - Version conflict resolution with clear indication of changes

4. **Collaborative Message History**
   - All collaborators see the same message history in real-time
   - New messages appear instantly for all active participants
   - Message metadata includes collaboration context (who initiated, who participated)
   - Real-time updates when messages are edited or deleted by any collaborator

**Integration Requirements:**

5. **Existing Conversation System Integration**
   - Current individual conversation functionality continues unchanged
   - Collaborative mode can be toggled on/off per conversation
   - Existing conversation persistence and retrieval works with collaborative data
   - Message export functionality includes collaboration metadata

6. **User Management Integration**
   - Leverages existing Supabase Auth for user identification
   - Integrates with current user session management
   - Respects existing user permissions and access controls
   - Works with current conversation sharing mechanisms

7. **Real-time Infrastructure Integration**
   - Builds on existing Supabase Realtime subscriptions
   - Extends current message update patterns for collaborative features
   - Maintains performance with existing real-time message delivery
   - Compatible with current offline/online state handling

**Quality Requirements:**

8. **Performance Standards**
   - Real-time updates delivered within 100ms under normal conditions
   - Supports up to 10 simultaneous collaborators per conversation
   - No noticeable performance degradation for individual users
   - Efficient bandwidth usage with selective update broadcasting

9. **Reliability & Resilience**
   - Handles network disconnections gracefully with automatic reconnection
   - Maintains data consistency across all collaborators
   - Provides clear feedback when real-time features are unavailable
   - Degrades gracefully to individual mode if collaboration fails

10. **User Experience**
    - Intuitive visual indicators for collaborative state
    - Clear feedback for collaboration actions (joining, leaving, editing)
    - Non-intrusive presence indicators that don't disrupt workflow
    - Smooth transitions between individual and collaborative modes

## Technical Implementation Notes

**Real-time Architecture:**
- **Collaboration Engine**: Implement using Supabase Realtime with custom presence and broadcast channels
- **Operational Transform**: Use Yjs or similar CRDT library for conflict-free collaborative editing
- **Cursor Tracking**: WebRTC-style cursor position sharing with user identification
- **State Synchronization**: Event-driven architecture with optimistic updates and conflict resolution

**Database Schema Extensions:**
```sql
-- Collaborative conversation participants
CREATE TABLE conversation_collaborators (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    conversation_id uuid REFERENCES conversations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    role text DEFAULT 'member', -- member, moderator
    joined_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
    last_seen timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
    is_active boolean DEFAULT true
);

-- Real-time collaboration events
CREATE TABLE collaboration_events (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    conversation_id uuid REFERENCES conversations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    event_type text NOT NULL, -- cursor_move, text_change, presence_update
    event_data jsonb NOT NULL,
    created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

**Component Integration:**
- **MessageInput Enhancement**: Add collaborative editing capabilities with live cursors
- **ChatArea Enhancement**: Display collaboration status and participant presence
- **Sidebar Enhancement**: Show collaborative conversation indicators
- **New Components**: CollaborationPanel, UserCursor, PresenceIndicator, CollaborationStatus

**Operational Transform Implementation:**
- **Text Operations**: Insert, delete, retain operations for text synchronization
- **Cursor Tracking**: Position transformation based on concurrent text changes
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-writer-wins with operational transformation for text merging
- **Event Ordering**: Vector clocks or timestamp-based ordering for consistent state

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Multiple users can join and collaborate on AI conversations in real-time
- [ ] Live cursors and typing indicators work smoothly with sub-second latency
- [ ] Concurrent message editing resolves conflicts without data loss
- [ ] All collaborators see synchronized message history and updates
- [ ] Integration maintains existing individual conversation functionality
- [ ] Performance standards met (100ms updates, 10 concurrent users)
- [ ] Handles network issues gracefully with automatic reconnection
- [ ] User experience is intuitive with clear collaboration feedback
- [ ] Database RLS policies secure collaborative data access
- [ ] Tests cover collaborative scenarios, conflict resolution, and edge cases
- [ ] Documentation updated with collaboration features and usage patterns

## Risk Assessment

**Primary Risk:** Real-time collaboration complexity could cause message conflicts, data inconsistency, or performance degradation affecting the user experience.

**Mitigation:** 
- Implement proven operational transformation libraries (Yjs) rather than custom solutions
- Add comprehensive conflict resolution testing with concurrent user simulations
- Include performance monitoring and automatic degradation to individual mode
- Implement retry mechanisms and clear error feedback for collaboration failures

**Rollback Plan:** 
- Feature flag system allows disabling collaboration per conversation or globally
- Fallback to existing individual conversation mode if collaboration fails
- Database rollback scripts to remove collaborative extensions if needed
- Clear communication to users when collaborative features are unavailable

## Dependencies

**Requires Completion:**
- Epic 7 (Enterprise Readiness) - ✅ User management and authentication system
- Epic 10 (Modern Web Platform) - ✅ WebRTC infrastructure and real-time capabilities

**Technical Dependencies:**
- Yjs or similar CRDT library for operational transformation
- Enhanced Supabase Realtime configuration for collaboration channels
- WebRTC cursor tracking capabilities from Epic 10
- Extended RLS policies for collaborative conversation access
