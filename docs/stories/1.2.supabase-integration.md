## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
**Story 1.1 (Project Setup)** completed successfully:
- Next.js project structure established
- TypeScript configuration complete
- Tailwind CSS with dark mode working
- Component architecture in place
- Testing infrastructure set up

### Data Models
Based on PRD requirements, need to implement:
- **Users**: Profile information, preferences, API keys
- **Conversations**: Title, creation date, associated user, model
- **Messages**: Content, role (user/assistant), conversation ID, timestamps
- **Settings**: User preferences, theme, default model
