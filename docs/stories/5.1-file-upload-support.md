# Story 5.1: File Upload Support - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a user,
I want to upload images and attach them to my messages,
So that I can use vision-capable AI models to analyze, describe, or discuss visual content.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: MessageInput component, message creation flow, OpenRouter API with vision models
- Technology: React components, Supabase Storage, Next.js file handling, existing message system
- Follows pattern: Existing message creation and validation patterns in MessageInput
- Touch points: Message creation, file storage, AI model integration, message display

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. File upload button integrated into MessageInput component with drag-and-drop support
2. Image preview displayed before sending with ability to remove/replace
3. File validation for supported formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP) and size limits (max 10MB)
4. Secure file upload to Supabase Storage with proper access controls
5. Vision model integration that sends images along with text prompts to compatible models

**Integration Requirements:**
6. Existing message creation workflow continues to work unchanged for text-only messages
7. New file upload follows existing validation and error handling patterns
8. Integration with current message display system shows uploaded images
9. File storage integrates with existing Supabase infrastructure

**Quality Requirements:**
10. File upload component is covered by appropriate unit tests
11. Security measures implemented for file validation and storage
12. Performance optimized for large image handling
13. Accessibility support for file upload interactions

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Extend MessageInput component with file upload capabilities, integrate with Supabase Storage
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Follow message validation patterns and error handling used in current MessageInput component  
- **Key Constraints**: Must maintain security best practices for file uploads, respect storage quotas and API limits

## Definition of Done

- [x] File upload UI integrated into MessageInput component ✅
- [x] Image preview and management implemented ✅
- [x] File validation and security measures implemented ✅
- [x] Supabase Storage integration working ✅
- [x] Vision model integration functional ✅
- [x] Existing message functionality regression tested ✅
- [x] Code follows existing patterns and standards ✅
- [x] Tests pass (existing and new) ✅
- [x] Security review completed for file handling ✅

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk**: Security vulnerabilities from malicious file uploads, storage quota exceeded
- **Mitigation**: Strict file validation, virus scanning, size limits, secure storage configuration
- **Rollback**: File upload feature can be disabled, falling back to text-only messaging

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [x] No breaking changes to existing message APIs ✅
- [x] Message display handles both text and image content gracefully ✅
- [x] File storage quota and access controls configured ✅
- [x] Performance impact on message creation is minimal ✅

## Implementation Summary

**Status: COMPLETED ✅** *(January 6, 2025)*

### Key Implementation Details:

**File Upload Component:**
- Integrated file upload button with drag-and-drop support in MessageInput component
- Added image preview with remove functionality
- Implemented file validation for JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP formats (max 10MB)

**Technical Solutions:**
- **Multiple File Chooser Fix**: Resolved issue with multiple file dialogs using `useCallback` and `fileInputRef`
- **Vision Model Integration**: Successfully integrated with Kimi VL (`moonshotai/kimi-vl-a3b-thinking:free`) vision model
- **Base64 Implementation**: Critical fix to use base64 data URIs for vision models instead of external URLs
- **Storage Integration**: Seamless Supabase Storage integration with proper RLS policies

**Files Modified:**
- `apps/web/src/components/chat/MessageInput.tsx`: Main file upload implementation
- `apps/web/src/lib/ai-service.ts`: Vision model integration with base64 support
- `apps/web/src/lib/database.ts`: Database model parameter fix
- `docs/database-schema.sql`: Storage bucket and RLS policy configuration

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ End-to-end testing completed with Playwright MCP server
- ✅ Successfully uploaded and analyzed test images with AI vision model
- ✅ Confirmed file validation, preview, storage, and AI integration work seamlessly
- ✅ No regressions in existing message functionality

**Performance:**
- Efficient base64 conversion for vision models
- Minimal impact on existing message creation workflow
- Proper loading states and error handling implemented
