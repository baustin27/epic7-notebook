# Story 9.5: Smart Conversation Management - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **user of the AI chat application**,
I want **AI-powered conversation organization, automatic tagging, priority detection, and intelligent archiving**,
So that **I can easily manage and access my growing conversation history without manual organization efforts**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing conversation listing and management components, Supabase storage
- Technology: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Supabase PostgreSQL, OpenRouter API, Zustand state management
- Follows pattern: Existing conversation filtering, sorting, and metadata patterns
- Touch points: Conversation list UI, metadata updates, archiving mechanisms

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Automatic tagging applies AI-generated labels based on conversation content and themes
2. Priority detection highlights important conversations using AI analysis of urgency and relevance
3. Intelligent archiving moves inactive conversations to storage with easy retrieval options

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing conversation creation, editing, and deletion functionality continues to work unchanged
5. New management features follow existing UI patterns for tags, filters, and list actions
6. Integration with Supabase maintains current behavior and adds metadata fields

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Tagging and priority accuracy are covered by appropriate unit and integration tests
8. Management operations perform without delaying conversation loading or listing
9. No regression in existing conversation lifecycle functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Add AI metadata service to analyze and update conversation records on creation/update, extend list components with tag filters and priority indicators
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Leverage existing metadata handling in conversation models and UI filtering from current dashboard patterns
- **Key Constraints:** Process tagging/archiving in background to maintain responsiveness, ensure user-editable tags with AI suggestions, comply with data retention policies for archiving

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Automatic tagging and priority detection implemented
- [ ] Intelligent archiving with retrieval UI functional
- [ ] Tags and priorities integrated into conversation list views
- [ ] User controls for manual adjustments added
- [ ] Integration with existing management UI verified
- [ ] Code follows existing TypeScript and data patterns
- [ ] Tests pass including management scenarios
- [ ] Supabase updates additive with new metadata columns

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Mis-tagging or incorrect archiving leading to lost access or cluttered organization
- **Mitigation:** Provide manual override and correction tools, use high-confidence AI thresholds, include search-based recovery for archived items
- **Rollback:** Feature flag to disable smart management, reverting to manual organization without metadata changes

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing conversation APIs
- [ ] Database changes are additive only (tag and priority columns)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing list design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible with background metadata processing
