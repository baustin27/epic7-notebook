# Story 9.6: Predictive AI Features - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **user of the AI chat application**,
I want **predictive text, smart response suggestions, conversation flow prediction, and proactive AI assistance**,
So that **I can communicate more efficiently with intelligent completions and anticipatory help during interactions**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing message input, conversation flow, OpenRouter API
- Technology: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Supabase PostgreSQL, OpenRouter API, Zustand state management
- Follows pattern: Existing autocomplete and real-time suggestion patterns in input fields
- Touch points: Typing input events, response generation, proactive notifications

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Predictive text offers word and phrase completions based on context and user history
2. Smart response suggestions provide relevant reply options during conversations
3. Conversation flow prediction anticipates user needs and suggests next actions
4. Proactive AI assistance triggers helpful interventions based on detected patterns

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Existing input and response functionality continues to work unchanged
5. New predictive features follow existing UI patterns for dropdown suggestions
6. Integration with OpenRouter API maintains current behavior and adds prediction calls

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Prediction accuracy and proactivity are covered by appropriate unit and integration tests
8. Suggestions appear with low latency (<200ms) without disrupting typing flow
9. No regression in existing message handling and conversation progression verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Enhance input hooks with predictive models via lightweight client-side logic and API for complex predictions, using conversation history for context
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Extend the existing message input autocomplete and suggestion overlays from current chat components
- **Key Constraints:** Balance prediction frequency to avoid overwhelming users, ensure opt-out for suggestions, optimize for low-bandwidth with local first predictions where possible

## Definition of Done

- [x] Predictive text and smart suggestions implemented in input field
- [x] Conversation flow prediction with action suggestions functional
- [x] Proactive assistance triggers integrated
- [x] User controls for prediction preferences added
- [x] Integration with existing chat UI verified
- [x] Code follows existing TypeScript and hook patterns
- [x] Tests pass including prediction scenarios
- [x] OpenRouter API usage for predictions optimized with caching

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Overly aggressive predictions or suggestions annoying users or providing inaccurate help
- **Mitigation:** Use user-configurable sensitivity levels, learn from dismissal feedback, ensure suggestions are optional and dismissible
- **Rollback:** Feature flag to disable predictive features, reverting to standard input without changes to core chat

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing input APIs
- [ ] No database changes required (history queried on-demand)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing suggestion design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible with client-optimized predictions
