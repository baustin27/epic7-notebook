# Story 2.3: Conversation Management - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a chat application user,
I want to create, rename, and delete conversations,
So that I can organize my chats and manage my conversation history effectively.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Existing Supabase conversations table and sidebar components
- Technology: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase
- Follows pattern: Existing CRUD patterns and sidebar navigation structure
- Touch points: Sidebar component, conversation context, Supabase client, routing

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. "New Conversation" button creates a new conversation and navigates to it
2. Conversation rename functionality accessible via context menu or inline editing
3. Conversation deletion with confirmation dialog removes conversation and messages
4. Sidebar displays conversation list with proper selection states

**Integration Requirements:**

5. Existing sidebar navigation patterns continue to work unchanged
6. New management functionality follows existing Tailwind CSS and component patterns
7. Integration with Supabase conversations table maintains current schema and relationships

**Quality Requirements:**

8. Conversation operations include proper error handling and loading states
9. Deletion confirmation prevents accidental data loss
10. No regression in existing conversation display and navigation verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extends existing Sidebar component with management actions, adds context menus
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow CRUD patterns from existing components, use established Supabase client methods
- **Key Constraints:** Must maintain conversation-message relationship integrity, preserve current routing behavior

## Definition of Done

- [x] New conversation creation working with proper navigation
- [x] Conversation rename functionality implemented with inline editing
- [x] Conversation deletion with confirmation dialog working
- [x] Sidebar UI updated with management controls (context menus/buttons)
- [x] All operations include loading states and error handling
- [x] Existing conversation navigation functionality regression tested
- [x] Code follows existing TypeScript and component patterns
